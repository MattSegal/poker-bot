	hole card (not yet)
	community cards (not yet)

THETA FILES

all theta files are organised with columns as:
theta mu sigma
all X values must be normalised before being classified
the digitsTheta.csv file uses the following column format:
theta0, theta1,...,thetaN,mu0,mu1,...,muN,sigma0,sigma1,...,sigmaN

CLASSIFICATION

hole and community cards were classified by the row x column sum of R B G respecitvely
that makes 3 features per input
they were classified using binary logistic regression to tell them apart from
scenarios where there were no cards

digits were classified based on sum of each row and column (16 features per img)
these images were preprocessed into binary form before classification
this is a one vs all classification
