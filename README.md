# Poker Bot

### Overview
This bot takes a screenshot of the PC display and identifies a PokerStars poker table in the image. If a table is found with a specifc configuration then the bot will attempt to record all of the relevant information from the table. This bot was intended to be a proof-of-concept for an online poker playing bot.

### Development Status
Currently the bot functions as intended for the images provided, and shows that it is possible to produce an online-poker playing bot based on screen-capture data. Further development on the bot stopped once it was functional, because of the huge time commitment that it would entail.
