# Poker Bot

### Before you read the source
I wrote this code while still learning a lot of basic programming concepts. For those who brave the source I must emplore you not to judge my current work by the swamp of brittle spaghetti you will find within.

### Overview
This bot takes a screenshot of the PC display and identifies a PokerStars poker table in the image. If a table is found with a specifc configuration then the bot will attempt to record all of the relevant information from the table. This bot was intended to be a proof-of-concept for an online poker playing bot.

To use the bot run 'python brain.py' in the terminal. Open an image from the tableExamples folder and make sure it is displayed on-screen at full size. Use 'Get Info' to pull data from the table image.

### Development Status
Currently the bot functions as intended for the images provided, and shows that it is possible to produce an online-poker playing bot based on screen-capture data. Further development on the bot stopped once it was functional, because of the huge time commitment that it would entail.
